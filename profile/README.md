Active Bridge is headquartered in Arizona, US, with an R&D center in Ukraine. We started in 2013 as a small team of Ukrainian developers with a passion for Ruby on Rails and an unstoppable drive to provide effective web solutions for our clients. Since then, we’ve successfully assisted our clients in developing and maintaining websites and web-based systems, mobile applications, and software products.
